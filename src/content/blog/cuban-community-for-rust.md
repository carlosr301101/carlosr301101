## Rust highlights

Rust defines itself as _Blazingly fast and memory-efficient_ and it's **true** [[1]](https://rust-lang.org), At this day Rust is the most respected Programming Language among developers. This language proposed a new way to manage memories leaks and dangling pointer as the cornerstone of the Rust's zen. The _borrow-checker_ is a new approach to achieve this goal and differentiate it from other languages. [[2]](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-00-understanding-ownership.html)

We use **Rust** in a lot of cases or services where performance and reliability is essential and we need to ship robust solutions with low chance to make mistakes, even though Rust isn't easy to learn, and demands a lot of effort and neurons on this learning process.

Most common uses of Rust are building CLIs and Terminal Applications but it has a wide range were Rust overcome other languages and has so much potential like Backend Architecture, HTTPS servers, IoT and so on. It is the strong community and hearth-bound to Rust principles that brings us powerfull tools like **uv** [[3]](https://docs.astral.sh/uv), **git-cliff** [[4]](https://git-cliff.org) and every day the list expands.

## Funding a Community

As a Nuclear Engineer, in my opinion Rust's power and reliability seems very similar to nuclear energy, and it has so much potential in this niche of science and strong secure processes. Rust safety gives us a fine-tune environment where we can explore, build , share projects with and for the dev community.

This is a first call to found **RustCubans** commmunity and start to build together and share experiences and knowledge, Rust has so much to thrive so on these community. Publishing your programs or apps on Cargo [[5]](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch14-02-publishing-to-crates-io.html) is a very easy way to be seen by the **rustaceans** (_International Rust Community_).

## First Steps With Rust.

Starting with Rust is very easy, if you have certain background in programming at low-level programming, if you know heap, stack and pointers, so you won't have any trouble to figure out how Rust works under the hood. For beginners I recommend using a different approach and start to learn like newborns, by imitation and asking to your confidant (_AI_) how things works, play with the code, don't be lazy and you won't fall into the imposter syndrome trap. Both types of learners will learn Rust with the same materials but by different ways.

1. Use the documentation [[6]](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch00-00-introduction.html) take your time to enjoy this delightful piece from dev community, is very easy to follow and has a lot of examples (_play with them_).

2. Use rustlings [[7]](https://rustlings.rust-lang.org), it's a gamified version of learn Rust and save your progress meanwhile they guide you through essentials of Rust.

3. Build a project, is the best way to learn and struggle with strange logics till all that darkness became clear, there is a few examples into the Rust Doc.

### **I hope you join this community, help it to grow, and reach out to everyone around to make it better.!!!**

panic!("Keep learning");
